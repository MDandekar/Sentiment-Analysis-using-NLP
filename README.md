### Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews using Natural Language Processing
Restaurant customers give their ratings and write reviews based on their satisfaction levels. These ratings and reviews help the other customers decide to go to those restaurants. These ratings are also helpful for restaurant owners to make changes based on their reviews for improving their business. Restaurant reviews contain textual information. But most of the machine learning algorithms work with numerical data only. Vectorizing is the process of encoding text as integers i.e. numeric form to create feature vectors so that machine learning algorithms can understand our data. For text-processing machine learning provides Natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. We can easily analyze our textual datasets through NLP methodologies. NLP provides an opportunity for data analysts to apply machine learning and deep learning algorithms to our textual datasets. We make use of 3 different machine learning algorithms for classifying reviews and recommend the best restaurant.
